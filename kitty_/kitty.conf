#: Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell yes

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

visual_bell_color none

#: The color used by visual bell. Set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color. If you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab "ðŸ”” "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell. If you want to use leading
#: or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

#: For backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

bell_path none

#: Path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to none, the
#: system default bell sound is used. Must be in a format supported by
#: the operating systems sound API, such as WAV or OGA on Linux
#: (libcanberra) or AIFF, MP3 or WAV on macOS (NSSound)

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  640
initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor are
#: drawn. Note that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides
#: this and causes all borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0 150

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges.

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this option when reloading config are undefined.

window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory. The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch action
#: or the remote control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/> facility.

window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: The time to wait before redrawing the screen when a resize event is
#: received (in seconds). On platforms such as macOS, where the
#: operating system sends events corresponding to the start and end of
#: a resize, this number is ignored.

resize_draw_strategy static

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set [0-9A-Z]. Specify your preference as a
#: string of characters.

confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge bottom

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_separator " â”‡"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. In addition you
#: can use {layout_name} for the current layout name, {num_windows}
#: for the number of windows in the tab and {num_window_groups} for
#: the number of window groups (not counting overlay windows) in the
#: tab. Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

active_tab_foreground   #000
active_tab_background   #eee
active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
inactive_tab_foreground #444

#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
